# 🚀 Flutter Folder Structure Helper — Supercharge Your Flutter Workflow in VS Code

Setting up a Flutter project structure can feel like riding a bike uphill — repetitive, slow, and often frustrating. Now imagine attaching a booster to that bike and flying up the hill. That’s exactly what Flutter Folder Structure Helper does for your development workflow.

This lightweight yet powerful VS Code extension helps you create a clean, scalable folder structure in seconds. With just one command, you can scaffold a complete Flutter project layout that includes state management (Provider), local storage with SharedPreferences, theme configuration, a splash screen setup, and more — all following best practices. No more wasting time manually creating folders and boilerplate files.

But it doesn’t stop there. This extension also gives you right-click context options to generate Stateless, Stateful, or even Stateful widgets with lifecycle methods like initState() and dispose(). You can also instantly create Provider classes with a single click, or package your project into a ZIP file for easy sharing.

Flutter Folder Structure Helper is the toolkit every VS Code-based Flutter developer needs. It’s designed to save you time, reduce clutter, and help you focus on what matters most — building great apps.
